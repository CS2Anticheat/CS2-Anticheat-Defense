# CS2-Anticheat-Defense (Private Project)

### CS2 AntiCheat Plugin based on CounterStrikeSharp helps prevent against cheaters.

***Take control of your server’s integrity with our custom-built Anti-Cheat plugin, designed specifically for Counter-Strike 2.***
***Built using CounterStrikeSharp, our system detects and reacts to suspicious behaviors in real time:***

## Requirements

- CounterStrikeSharp
- Metamod

`
🎯 Aimbot Detection – Flick speed, angular velocity, crosshair lock, silent aim, triggerbot patterns.

🧠 Advanced Aim Pattern Tracking – Detect rage or closet cheaters based on aim snap speed, accuracy threshold, and headshot consistency.

🔥 Silent Aim / Instant Flick Detection – Analyzes unrealistic transitions to heads and fast kills not possible with human aim.

📈 Smoothness & Reaction Analysis – Flags bots with unnatural aim smoothing or no reaction time.

🕵️ Wallhack – not fully supported, but included detections.

📢 Spam Detection – Radio spam, bunnyhop macros, macro strafing.

📤 Discord Webhook Integration – Auto-report detections with evidence & player stats directly to your server.
